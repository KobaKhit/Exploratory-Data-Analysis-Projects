# Exploratory data analysis
This repo contains solutions to two projects from the "Exploratory Data Analysis" Coursera course.
##Project 1
The directions for the Project 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/KobaKhit/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/README.md). In short, the assingment is to write four R scripts that when executed retrieve necessary data, produce a plot, and save it as a `.png` file. In folder Project 1 you will find four R scripts `plot1.R`,`plot2.R`, etc. and four corresponding plots `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.
